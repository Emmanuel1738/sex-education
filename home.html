  <h2>Sex Education</h2>
   <p>Sexuality education has positive effects, including increasing young people's knowledge and improving their attitudes related to sexual and reproductive health and behaviors. Our site is to educate all generations about the importance of sex education and its accompanied cons.</p>
<h2>Importance of Sex Education</h2>
<p>1.Gender identity.
  

  A nationally representative survey in 2012 (Clark et al, 2013) found that transgender students are a numerically small but important group. Over 8,000 secondary school students answered the question about whether they were transgender: 96 students reported being transgender (1.2%), and 202 reported not being sure (2.5%). </p>
<P>2.Meaningful content.


  Students prefer programmes that connect with their lives, are relevant, interactive, and student-centred. Students should be involved in setting content and in contributing to pedagogical decisions (Allen, 2005, 2007a; Education Review Office, 2007b). </P>
<P>3.Information rather than risk.


  Programmes should engage, empower, and inform young people rather than focus on risk (Fine & McClelland, 2006, Fitzpatrick, 2014). Research suggests that abstinence programmes make no difference in affecting sexual decision-making (Kirby, 2008; Poobalan et al, 2009) while programmes with a more holistic and comprehensive approach significantly reduce risk factors and risky behaviours (Kirby, 2008; Bearinger et al, 2007). </P>
